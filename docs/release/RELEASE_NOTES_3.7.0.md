## ✨ What's New

### ☁️ Google Drive OAuth Enhancements

#### Client Secret Support

- **Web Application OAuth Credentials**: Full support for "Web application" type OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
  - New `Client Secret` input field in Advanced settings
  - Automatic secret handling in token exchange and refresh flows
  - Backwards compatible with "Chrome Extension" type credentials (no secret required)
  - Enables users to use existing Google Cloud projects

#### Why This Matters

Previously, the extension only worked with "Chrome Extension" type OAuth credentials. Now users can:
- Use existing Google Cloud projects with web credentials
- Have more flexibility in OAuth setup
- Choose the credential type that fits their needs

#### User-Configured OAuth (NEW!)

- **No Default Credentials**: Users now configure their own Google Cloud OAuth credentials
  - Paste JSON credentials directly from Google Cloud Console
  - Automatic parsing of "Web application" or "Desktop app" credential JSON
  - Smart redirect URI validation per browser type
  - Clear setup instructions in the popup

---

### 💾 Comprehensive Backup System (NEW!)

#### Full Extension Backup

- **Everything in One File**: Create complete backups including:
  - Novel library with all reading progress
  - All Gemini API keys (primary and backup)
  - Custom prompts (main, summary, short summary, permanent)
  - Site-specific prompts and settings
  - Theme preferences
  - Model configuration
  - Google Drive OAuth credentials (encrypted)
  - Library settings (auto-hold, etc.)

#### Rolling Auto-Backups

- **Automatic Protection**: Browser storage keeps up to 5 recent backups
  - Triggered automatically when library changes
  - Quick restore without needing external files
  - View, restore, or delete individual backups from popup
  - Toggle auto-backups on/off per preference

#### Easy Migration

- Export from one browser, import to another
- Share settings across devices
- Recover from accidental data loss

---

### 📊 Anonymous Analytics (Opt-Out) (NEW!)

#### CFlair-Counter Integration

- **Anonymous View Tracking**: Uses [CFlair-Counter](https://github.com/Life-Experimentalist/CFlair-Counter) for simple view counts
  - **Enabled by default** (opt-out model)
  - First-run dialog informs users about analytics
  - Can be disabled anytime in Library Settings

#### What's Collected

- Anonymous view counts per feature (via CFlair-Counter API)
- Error reports (if enabled separately)

#### What's NEVER Collected

- ❌ API keys or credentials
- ❌ Novel reading history or library data
- ❌ Personal information of any kind

#### Custom Webhook Support

- Send diagnostics to your own endpoint (in addition to CFlair-Counter)
- Useful for self-hosted debugging
- Fully transparent data flow

---

### 📢 Enhanced Notification System

#### Centralized Notification Manager

- **Unified Notification Handling**: All notifications now go through a centralized manager
  - Detailed logging with metadata
  - Novel data caching for better context
  - Enhanced display in popup with rich metadata
  - Improved badge updating
  - Notification history clearing

#### Smart Progress Tracking

- **Progress Update Prompts**: Automatic detection when your saved progress is behind
  - Banner UI for quick progress updates
  - Cooldown mechanism prevents spam
  - Smart status transitions (Reading → Plan to Read, etc.)
  - Dismiss functionality with "don't show again" option

---

### 🎯 Domain-Specific Settings

#### Per-Domain Feature Control

- **Site Settings Management**: Toggle features on specific websites
  - Enable/disable auto-enhancement per domain
  - Domain-level configuration storage
  - Granular control over extension behavior
  - Independent settings for each supported site

---

   - Expand "Advanced setup (optional)"
	- Enter your OAuth Client Secret
   - Click "Connect Google Drive"

#### Settings & Data

- ✅ All existing settings preserved

---

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### OAuth Flow Enhancement

```javascript
// Now supports both credential types
const params = {
  client_id: clientId,
  // ... other OAuth params
};

// Web Application type includes secret
if (clientSecret) {
  params.client_secret = clientSecret;
}
```

### Popup Initialization Fix

```javascript
// Fixed race condition
const startPopup = async () => {
  await initializePopup();
};

if (document.readyState === "loading") {
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", startPopup);
} else {
  startPopup(); // Already loaded
}
```

---

## 📝 Known Issues

### Google Drive OAuth

- **Security Note**: Web Application credentials expose client secret in extension storage. For public distribution, consider using Chrome Extension type credentials instead.
- **Extension ID**: Must be hardcoded in Google Cloud Console for proper OAuth redirect handling

### Workarounds

- For maximum security, use "Chrome Extension" type OAuth credentials
- Keep client secrets private if using Web Application credentials
- See documentation for detailed OAuth setup guide

## Ranobe Gemini v3.7.0 — Firefox Release Notes (Short)

**Release Date:** Jan 30, 2026

### Highlights

- **Google Drive OAuth enhanced**
  Supports **Web Application** credentials with client secret, while staying compatible with **Chrome Extension** creds. Users can now paste OAuth JSON directly in Advanced settings.

- **Comprehensive Backup System**
  Full backups include library, progress, API keys, prompts, settings, theme, model config, and encrypted Drive OAuth. Includes **auto-rolling backups** (up to 5) with restore and delete controls.

- **Anonymous Analytics (Opt‑Out)**
  Uses **CFlair‑Counter** for anonymous view counts. No personal data or keys collected. Optional custom webhook support.

- **Notification System Overhaul**
  Centralized manager with better logging, badge updates, notification history, and smart progress prompts with cooldowns.

- **Domain-Specific Settings**
  Per-site feature toggles for granular control.

### Major Fixes

- Popup UI reliability fixes: initialization, tabs, settings fields, prompt loading.
- Google Drive OAuth error fixes ("client_secret missing"), improved refresh handling.
- Website handlers: better detection, metadata extraction, and stability across sites (FanFiction.net, Ranobes.net, AO3, ScribbleHub).

### Notes

- Web App OAuth credentials store client secrets in extension storage; **Chrome Extension credentials are safer** for public use.
- Extension ID must be set in Google Cloud for proper redirects.
