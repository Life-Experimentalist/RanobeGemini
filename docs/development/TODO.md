## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical

- None currently

### High Priority

- [ ] WebNovel handler disabled — re-enable after infinite-scroll fix
- [ ] Long chapters (> 100 k chars) may time out during chunking on slow connections

### Medium Priority

- [ ] FanFiction mobile: Cover images sometimes fail to load due to CORS
- [ ] AO3: Custom tags beyond the first 20 are not extracted
- [ ] Cache entries are never automatically evicted; manual clear required

### Low Priority

- [ ] Sites with strict CSP partially block injected button styles
- [ ] Library grid card height inconsistent with very long tag lists

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

- [ ] Background service worker (`background.js`) is very large — split into `api.js`, `chunking.js`, `drive.js`, `storage.js`
- [ ] Add unit tests for handlers (mock DOM), storage manager, novel library
- [ ] TypeScript migration — start with utility modules; add JSDoc types in the interim
- [ ] Build system: add source maps for debug builds; minify production bundles

---

## 💡 Feature Requests

- [ ] Offline reading — store enhanced chapters in IndexedDB
- [ ] EPUB/PDF export from library
- [ ] Text-to-speech integration with Incognito Mode
