export const DEFAULT_PROMPT = `Please enhance this novel chapter translation with the following improvements:

1. Fix grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and spelling issues
2. Improve the narrative flow and overall readability
3. Ensure consistent character voice, tone, and gender pronouns throughout
4. Make dialogue sound more natural and conversational
5. Refine descriptions to be more vivid and engaging
6. Maintain the original plot points, character development, and story elements exactly
7. Streamline overly verbose sections while preserving important details
8. Ensure proper transitioning between scenes and ideas
9. Add bold section headings at scene changes, POV shifts, or topic transitions. If the original text already has section headings, incorporate them seamlessly and consistently
10. **IMPORTANT:** Format game-like status windows, character stats, skill lists, or RPG system information into styled HTML boxes. Use a div with class="game-stats-box" to contain the exact text. For example, a status window like:
    Player: Mike
    Level: 0
    Equipment: None
    Skills: None
    Class: Unspecialized
    Experience: 0
    Overall Combat Power: 5

    Should be formatted as:
    <div class="game-stats-box">
		Player: Mike
		Level: 0
		Equipment: None
		Skills: None
		Class: Unspecialized
		Experience: 0
		Overall Combat Power: 5
	</div>

    Preserve all line breaks, formatting, and exact data within these status windows. if there are any text in [ square brackets ] please pay attention to if they sound like system announcements or game-like status windows, and format them accordingly. Be especially attentive to identifying stat blocks, status screens, system messages, skill descriptions, or any RPG-game-like information that should be formatted this way.
11. Remove any advertising code snippets or irrelevant promotional content

Keep the core meaning of the original text intact while making it feel like a professionally translated novel. Preserve all original story elements including character names, locations, and plot points precisely.`;
