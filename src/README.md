## Why Use Ranobe Gemini?

Many web translations can lose the unique voice and literary style inherent in the original work. Ranobe Gemini bridges this gap by using state-of-the-art AI to enhance readability and quality—making your reading experience more enjoyable and immersive. Whether you're a casual reader or a dedicated fan of web novels, this extension transforms clunky translations into fluid and engaging narratives without compromising the story's integrity.

## How It Works

Upon activation, Ranobe Gemini scans the webpage for targeted content areas using customized selectors. It then sends the extracted text to Google's Gemini AI, which processes the content based on user-specified configuration settings. Once the refined text is returned, the extension seamlessly integrates the enhanced version back onto the page, complete with an optional notice indicating that the content has been enhanced by advanced AI. This process ensures that the final output not only reads naturally but also closely adheres to the nuances of the source material.
